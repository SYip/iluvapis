So it seems like everyone is talking about Big Data and APIs.  The best part of all this is that is has all sorts of web analytics geeks like myself holding back the "I told you so.." comments when envisioning how we'll move away for traditional methods (e.g. DBs and Web Bugs) to more suitable means (e.g api gateways and Hadoop, Hbase and Hive, etc).

Anyone who has worked with me knows I tend to be a pragmatic guy.  I typically, gravitate towards solutions that quickly and easily get solve the business issues presented before me.

"At first glance this is an area (Big Data) somewhat unrelated to the API management space and on some levels that’s a fair comment. But at the same time if we look at analytics as an area that required the combination, analysis and outputting of data from various locations, we can see that it’s actually relatively close to the API management space." - forbes.com

This is totally accurate and fair assumption made as a criticism.  But it also neglects to assert the commonality between APIs and Mobile space.  IMHO, APIs and Big Data hold the same sort of relationship as APIs and Mobile since they represent a valuable means-to-an-end.

I think is safe to say that if have rock solid mobile strategy, your business has probably fully embraced the value of API Management.  You may have even  shuffled across multiple API vendors looking the right fit for your organization. Where enterprises are using APIs to deliver business in the mobile space, this same value can be equally and perhaps more substantially be made in the Big Data landscape.

Simply put, You build an API *because* you want a great mobile app.  Similarly you must consume and deliver APIs to achieve truly Big and Broad data strategy.  Just as mobile APIs have been delivered to extend business functionality into Apps.  Big Data APIs will be a natural counterpart to the collection, transforming, composing and transmitting data to the consumer Data Scientist.

I also find it quite convenient that so much of the Big Data space also revolves around JSON and HTTP.  This has those of use devoted to pragmatic REST principles reusing much of the foundational expertise as those working with MongoDB or Hive.

But who represents the consumer app in the Big Data and API relationship?  The Data Scientist of perhaps?  

Wikipedia defines the data science as: 

"the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data, yet the key word is science. It incorporates varying elements and builds on techniques and theories from many fields, including signal processing, mathematics, probability models, machine learning, statistical learning, computer programming, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and high performance computing with the goal of extracting meaning from data and creating data products."

The key terms here to me are "generalizable extraction", "theories from many fields" and "signal processing".  This hold much of same meaning to me as extracting data from HTTP payload or composition of multiple REST and SOAP Web Services.

In fact, the Data Scientist as a practitioner and the API Architect have a lot of similarities when you look at the venn diagram used for Data Science transposed .
